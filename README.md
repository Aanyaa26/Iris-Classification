## Overview

This project demonstrates a supervised learning approach to classify the species of an Iris flower based on four key features:

1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

Using these features, the classifier can predict the species among *Setosa*, *Versicolour*, and *Virginica*.

---

## Dataset

The **Iris Dataset** is widely used in data science and machine learning for classification tasks. It consists of **150 samples** with the following columns:

- **Features:** Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- **Target:** Species (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica)

The dataset is available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

```

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Iris-Classification.git
cd Iris-Classification
```

---

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**  
   Open the Jupyter Notebook environment:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**  
   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the `notebooks/iris_classification.ipynb` file and open it.

3. **Run Cells Sequentially**  
   Execute each cell to load the dataset, explore data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Performance

The classifier was evaluated primarily on **accuracy**. Below are some example results based on common classifiers:

| Model              | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 95%      |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 96%      |
| Decision Tree      | 94%      |

---

## Results

The models performed well on the dataset, achieving high accuracy for classifying the three Iris species. The **SVM model** performed the best in this setup.

---

## Future Improvements

Consider the following potential improvements:

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Tune the model for better performance.
- **Model Comparison:** Experiment with ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- **Visualizations:** Add more visualizations for feature importance and decision boundaries.
